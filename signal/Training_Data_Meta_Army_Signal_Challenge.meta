    "Assembling Chunks":"To assemble chunks, simply extend each key's array of instances with that key's arrays from the other chunks",
    "Chunk Description":"There are 15 chunks (pieces) that together form the total dataset. Each chunk contains 2000 instances each for all 144 keys. They can be used as smaller versions of the total dataset, or each key can be appended with that key's data from another chunk to form a larger dataset. No data is repeated across chunks.",

    "Description":"These collects were taken from captures with the following characteristics. The sample rate was randomly chose from 2e5, 5e5, 1e6, and 2e6. The samples per symbol was randomly chosen from 4, 8, 12, 16. Therefore there are 16 possible baud (symbol) rates. The simulated transmitter is transmitting continuously.",
